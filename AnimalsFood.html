						<p><b>1.</b> Tigers primarily hunt deer, but as opportunistic predators, they can also eat wild
							boars, birds, fish, rodents, amphibians, reptiles, and even insects. A large deer can
							provide a tiger with one week's food, but only one out of every ten hunts is successful..
							Diet
							Tigers eat a variety of prey ranging in size from termites to elephant calves. However, an
							integral component of their diet are large-bodied prey weighing about 20 kg (45 lbs.) or
							larger such as moose, deer species, pigs, cows, horses, buffalos and goats. Occasionally
							they may consume tapirs, elephant and rhinoceros calves, bear species, leopards and Asiatic
							wild dogs.

							Method of Feeding
							Tigers mainly rely on their sense of sight and hearing rather than on smell when hunting
							prey. They cautiously stalk their prey from the rear in attempt to get as close as possible
							to their unsuspecting prey. Then they attempt to take down their prey with a powerful bite
							to the neck and/ or throat.

							Tigers may consume up to 40 kg (88 lbs.) of meat at one time.

							It is estimated that every tiger consumes about 50 deer-sized animals each year, about one
							per week.

						<p><b>1.</b>Lions primarily eat large animals that weigh from 100 to 1,000 pounds (45 to 453
							kilograms), such as zebra and wildebeest. In times of shortage, they also catch and eat a
							variety of smaller animals, from rodents to reptiles. Lions also steal kills from hyenas,
							leopards and other predators. At times, they may lose their own catches to hyena groups.
							Lions may also feed on domestic livestock, especially in areas near villages.

							The Smithsonian's National Zoo's lions eat ground beef, which is commercially produced to
							meet the nutritional needs of carnivores. Twice a week, they receive knucklebones or beef
							femurs, and once a week they receive rabbits, which exercise the cats' teeth and jaws. then
							day two provides you an opportunity to eat only vegetables throughout the day.
