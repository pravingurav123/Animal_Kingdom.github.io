					<p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;"><b>-</b>Carnivores are animals
						that prey on other animals in order to survive. The meat is the most essential part of their
						diet. They have physical features that allow them to efficiently hunt, capture and devour their
						target.

						However, it is not necessary for the carnivores to be big in size to capture their prey. For

					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">- The big cats you see are all carnivores. The tiger is the largest of all that is very deadly and ferocious. They sneak up on their prey and camouflage using their stripes. Their daily meal consists of almost 40 to 85 pounds of meat. They usually live alone as they prefer eating their whole prey in a single kill.</p><br>

					<h4>2.Sharks</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-Sharks are one of the most feared aquatic carnivores with speed, sharp teeth, and immense power. They are quite large in size and very deadly. The most dangerous is easily the great white shark. The average shark swims at fifteen miles per hour. Their speed enables them to catch their prey and their sharp teeth assist them in devouring their prey. Most importantly, they can even smell drops of blood from more than three miles away.</p><br>

					<h4>3.The Corsac Fox</h4>
					<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 28px; text-align: justify;">-The Corsac Fox, also called the steppe fox and the sand fox, is a species of Asian foxes that are widely spread throughout their range. However, the populations of the corsac fox are known to fluctuate significantly, as their numbers can drop tenfold within a yearâ€™s time. These foxes have ever been threatened by hunting for the fur trade. Corsac foxes usually try to stay far away from human disturbances like the areas used for agricultural purposes. Hence, they are not considered as pests.</p><br>
