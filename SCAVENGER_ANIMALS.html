									animals that consume dead organisms that have died from causes other than predation
									or have been killed by other predators.[1] While scavenging generally refers to
									carnivores feeding on carrion, it is also a herbivorous feeding behavior.[2]
									Scavengers play an important role in the ecosystem by consuming dead animal and
									plant material. Decomposers and detritivores complete this process, by consuming the
									remains left by scavengers.

									Scavengers aid in overcoming fluctuations of food resources in the environment.[3]
									The process and rate of scavenging is affected by both biotic and abiotic factors,
									such as carcass size, habitat, temperature, and seasons.[4]</i></b> – Buddha <br>

								<td colspan="2">Hyenas or hyaenas (/haɪˈjiːnə/ HI-yee-nə; from Ancient Greek ὕαινα, hýaina),[1] are
									feliform carnivoran mammals belonging to the family Hyaenidae /haɪˈɛnɪdiː/. With
									just four extant species (each in its own genus), it is the fifth-smallest family in
									the Carnivora and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia.[2] Despite their low
									diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.[3]

									Although phylogenetically closer to felines and viverrids, hyenas are behaviourally
									and morphologically similar to canids in several elements due to convergent
									evolution: both hyenas and canines are non-arboreal, cursorial hunters that catch
									prey with their teeth rather than claws. Both eat food quickly and may store it, and
									their calloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable claws are adapted for running
									and making sharp turns. However, hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecation habits,
									mating and parental behavior are consistent with the behavior of other feliforms.[4]

								<td  colspan="2">The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl.: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and dingo, though gray wolves, as popularly understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.

									Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour, including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial, and fights over territory are among the principal causes of mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. Pathogens and parasites, notably the rabies virus, may infect wolves.</td>

								<td  colspan="2">The raccoon (/rəˈkuːn/ or US: /ræˈkuːn/ ⓘ, Procyon lotor), also spelled racoon[3] and sometimes called the common raccoon to distinguish it from other species, is a mammal native to North America. It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas relating to the animal. The raccoon is noted for its intelligence, as studies show that it is able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years. It is usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates.

									The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability, they have extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them to be pests. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across central Europe, the Caucasus, and Japan.</td>
